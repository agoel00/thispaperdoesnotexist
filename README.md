"Unsupervised Temporal Compressive Imaging: A New Method for
  Classification"

"Temporal Compressive Imaging (TcI) is a popular method for deep convolutional
neural networks (CNN) for image classification. TcI uses a convolutional
transform to estimate the temporal sequence of a CNN. This context-sensitive
recall mechanism is coupled with a "mind-body-mind" model, which is a
powerful framework for visual-spatial-spatial navigation. We show that
TcI can be used for image classification in an unsupervised fashion. First,
we show that, with the help of a convolutional-transform, the temporal sequence
is obtained by the convolutional-transform. Then, we introduce a TcI
classifier to explain the temporal sequence obtained by the convolutional
transform with respect to the convolutional-transform. These results are
interpretable to further classify the images. They show that TcI can be
used for both low-level and high-level learning tasks. We also use TcI for
image classification in the context of the epileptic person. We validate our
methods on a large dataset of images and show that they are able to solve
the tasks of the epileptic person."

These titles and abstracts have been generated by a fine tuned GPT-2 model.
The model has 345M parameters and has been trained on ~30k papers from arxiv.

The results are generated at a temperature=0.7

The model has learnt a lot of contextual meaning from the abstracts and the 
generated titles and abstracts are really good for a training time of just 40 minutes.

### TODO
- [x] Train on ~30k papers
- [x] Deploy on website as POC
- [ ] Train on more papers
- [ ] Upload fine-tuned weights
